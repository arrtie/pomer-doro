# Pomer-doro

## Getting Started

Pomer-doro uses Astro, Typescript, and Playwright.

### Development

> this project is setup to run within a [Devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial)

To start the development server on port 4321:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or run in debug mode within VSCode's side bar

- click `Run and Debug`
- from the dropdown select `Debug Session`
- click the play button (green triangle)

This will make the application available at <http://localhost:4321> and accessible on your local network.

This command runs TypeScript compilation first, then builds the project with Vite.
